    "This code is designed to recommend similar video games based on their genres and combined scores. It uses a TF-IDF vectorization and nearest neighbors approach to find games with similar features and scores. Here are the important steps in the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: The code preprocesses the game data, specifically the 'Genres' and 'Combined Score' columns. It fills missing values in the 'Genres' column with empty strings and missing 'Combined Score' values with zeros. It also creates a new 'Features' column by combining 'Genres' and 'Combined Score' as strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: It creates a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer called `tfidf_vectorizer_combined`. This vectorizer is used to transform the 'Features' column into a numerical representation suitable for similarity calculations. It converts the text data into a numerical format that the machine learning model can work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Nearest Neighbors Model**: The code builds a nearest neighbors model named `knn_combined` using the NearestNeighbors class from scikit-learn. This model uses the cosine distance metric and is fitted with the TF-IDF transformed data. It is designed to find the most similar games based on the features and scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recommendation Function**: The `recommend_similar_games` function takes a list of input games, and for each input game, it performs the following steps:\n",
    "   - Find the index of the given input game in the DataFrame.\n",
    "   - Use the nearest neighbors model to find the most similar games based on combined features.\n",
    "   - Sort the recommendations by the \"Combined Score\" in descending order.\n",
    "   - Filter out the input games themselves and any duplicates from previous recommendations.\n",
    "   - Append up to 5 unique recommendations to the `recommended_games` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Example Usage**: The code provides an example usage with three input games: \"Galactic Bowling,\" \"Circle of Sumo,\" and \"Dr. Tacocat.\" It then calls the `recommend_similar_games` function with these input games. The recommendations are printed, showing the input game and its top recommendations. If no recommendations are found, it displays a message indicating that no recommendations were found for the input games.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code ensures that there are up to 5 recommendations for each input game and that duplicates of input games or previous recommendations are filtered out, resulting in a list of unique game recommendations."
